## Section C: Connecting to the VPS & Installing the NAV Script via Putty

***Step 1***
* Copy your VPS IP (you can find this by going to the server tab within Vultr and clicking on your server. 
![Example-Vultr](https://i.imgur.com/z41MiwY.png)
***

***Step 2***
* Open the Putty application and fill in the "Host Name" box with the IP address of your VPS.
![Example-PuttyInstaller](https://imgur.com/WffwFYW.png)
***

***Step 3***
* Once you have hit enter it will open a security alert (click yes).
![Example-RootPassEnter](https://imgur.com/x7ILFUy.png)
***

***Step 4***
* Type "root" as the login/username.
![Example-Root](https://imgur.com/S0fcGzm.png)
***

***Step 5***
* Copy the root password from the VULTR server page.

![Example-RootPassEnter](https://i.imgur.com/JnXQXav.png)
***

***Step 6*** 
* Paste the password into the Putty terminal by right clicking (it will not show the password so just press enter).
![Example-RootPassEnter](https://imgur.com/65jWobg.png)
***

***Step 7***
* Adduser to secure your VPS, by adding a new username so you aren't running everything as root.  
* Run the command below and use a username that you want associated with this server ***('nullexnav1' is an example, you need to use your own username).***  

`adduser nullexnav1`

***

***Step 8***

* You will then need to make a new password associated with your new username.  Hit 'Enter' for the next 5 lines after your new password has been set, then 'Y' to save your information.

![Example-Bash](https://imgur.com/mrhihrj.png)

***

***Step 9***

* The final step is granting sudo permissions for your adduser.  Run the command below to activate this setting ***('nullexnav1' is an example, you need to use your username).***

`usermod -aG sudo nullexnav1`

* Now you will close your Putty terminal and log back with your new username and password that we made above.  

![Example-Bash](https://imgur.com/FUFkEFu.png)

* ***KEEP YOUR NEW USERNAME AND PASSWORD IN A SAFE PLACE.  THIS WILL BE HOW YOU LOG IN FROM NOW ON.***
***

***Step 10***

***YOU ONLY NEED TO RUN THESE 2 COMMANDS IF IT'S A NEW INSTALL.  IF YOU ARE JUST UPDATING A PREVIOUS INSTALL, YOU ONLY NEED TO RUN THE COMMAND IN STEP 11.***

* Paste the 2 codes below separately into the Putty terminal then press enter after each one (it will just go to a new line)

`wget https://github.com/white92d15b7/nullex-nav-installer/blob/master/nullex-nav-installer.sh`

`sudo chmod +x nullex-nav-installer.sh`

![Example-RootPassEnter](https://imgur.com/dDbHPnt.png)

***

***Step 11***
* Paste the code below into the Putty terminal then press enter.  ***(THE BELOW COMMAND WILL ALSO BE USED FOR ANY UPDATES THAT ARE MADE TO THE SCRIPT.  YOU WILL JUST RUN THIS SINGLE COMMAND, AND NOT THE 2 ABOVE.  THEY ARE ONLY FOR THE INITIAL INSTALL.)***

`sudo sh nullex-nav-installer.sh`

![Example-Bash](https://imgur.com/iOSuHgl.png)

***NOTE*** ***(DO NOT RUN THIS COMMAND IF YOU'VE ALREADY RUN THE ONE ABOVE)

The above cmd will install using IPv6 by default. If you are only going to be setting up a single NAV, and you prefer to use IPv4 instead you can force the install to use your IPv4 IP address by using  

`sudo sh nullex-nav-installer.sh -N 4`

***

***Step 12***
* Sit back and wait for the install (this will take a few mins).  You will need a txt file to save info from Step 11.
***

***Step 13***
* After the install is complete, scroll up a little bit in the terminal.  
![Example-installing](https://imgur.com/MPeaDrd.png)
***

***Step 14***
* Save your IP address, port and masternodeprivkey in the txt file that we made earlier, you will need this info for your masternode config file. 
***

***Step 15***
* Keep this terminal open, so that we can check the block count and NAV status in future steps.
***

## Section D: Preparing the Local Wallet

***Step 1 (if neccessary)***
* Download and install the NulleX wallet [here](https://github.com/white92d15b7/NLX/releases/download/1.3.6/nullex-qt.exe)
***

***Step 2***
* Create a text document to temporarily store information that you will need. 
***

***Step 3***
* Go to the debug console within the wallet, type the command below and press enter.
* NAV1 is used as an example, name your NAV whatever you want.

`getaccountaddress <NAV1>`

![Example-console](https://i.imgur.com/6NM7G9a.png)
***

***Step 4***
* Send EXACLY 50,000 NulleX to the receive address within your wallet that was generated in Step 3.  Do not send any extra for fees, click ***Choose*** (right next to ***Transaction Fee***) and check the box for ***Send as zero-fee transaction***.

![Example-console](https://imgur.com/FBVOnyA.png)
***

***Step 5***
* Go to the debug console within the wallet 

![Example-console](https://i.imgur.com/6NM7G9a.png)
***

***Step 6***
* Type the command below and press enter 

`masternode outputs` 

![Example-outputs](https://i.imgur.com/GD7Ro1m.png)
***

***Step 7***
* Copy the long key (this is your transaction ID) and the 0 or 1 at the end (this is your output index)
* Paste these into the text document you created earlier as you will need them in the next step.

![Example-outputs](https://imgur.com/Z9lsQyd.png)
***

# Section E: Connecting & Starting the NAV

***Step 1***
* Go to the tools tab within the wallet and click open "masternode configuration file" 

![Example-create](https://i.imgur.com/COsfvfA.png)
***

***Step 2***
* Start a new line for each NAV at the bottom, and make it look like the example on the last line of existing info, but with your info.

 `'Alias' 'VPS IP Address:Port' 'Genkey' 'TxHash' 'Output Index'` ***(Do not use a # at the beginning)***

* For `Alias` use the one you made for ***Section D: Step 3***
* The `VPS IP Address:Port` is the IP from ***Section C: Step 1*** and the dedicated Port is ***43879***.
* The `GenKey` is your masternode genkey from ***Section C: Step 11***.
* The `TxHash` is the transaction ID/long key that you copied to the text file from ***Section D: Step 6 and 7***.
* The `Output Index` is the 0 or 1 that you copied to your text file from ***Section D: Step 6 and 7***.

![Example-create](https://imgur.com/tMkdY7h.png)
* Click "File Save"
***

***Step 3***
* Check the status of your VPS wallet to make sure it's on the same block as your controller wallet.

`nullex-cli getblockcount`

![Example-console](https://imgur.com/B4Wk0in.png)
***

***Step 4***
* Close out of the controller wallet and reopen it
* ***UNLOCK YOUR WALLET TO START YOUR NAV!!!!!!!!!!!!!!***
* Go to the debug console within the wallet, type the command below and press enter

`startmasternode alias false YOUR-NAV-ALIAS`

![Example-console](https://i.imgur.com/6NM7G9a.png)

![Example-console](https://imgur.com/86XpkOc.png)
***

***Step 5***
* Check the status of your NAV within the VPS by using the command below in Putty terminal:

`nullex-cli masternode status`

* You should see ***status 4 or 9***
